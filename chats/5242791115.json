It operates in countries like Pakistan, catering to the needs of employees who may require immediate funds to handle emergencies or unexpected expenses.\n\nThe service is offered through a mobile app, where registered users can request an advance on their earned income. This is not a loan but rather an advance on wages they have already earned through their work. The idea is to offer financial flexibility and help employees avoid predatory lending practices or high-interest loans by providing access to their earnings when they need it the most.\n\nIf you have specific questions or need assistance with the Abhi Finance App, please let me know, and I'd be happy to help!"

            "content": "Abhi provides an advance on an employee's earned wages through their mobile platform, which is based on the concept of Earned Wage Access (EWA). Here's how the process generally works:\n\n1. **Integration with Employers:** Abhi partners with employers to integrate their system with the company's payroll. This integration allows Abhi to determine the amount of money that an employee has earned but not yet been paid.\n\n2. **Employee Registration:** Employees of partnered companies can sign up for Abhi through the app. They need to provide necessary details to verify their employment and the amount they can withdraw based on their earned wages.\n\n3. **Requesting an Advance:** Once registered, employees can use the app to check how much of their earned wages are available for advance at any given time. If they need funds, they can request an advance for a portion of the wages they've already earned but which haven't been paid out yet by their employer.\n\n4. **Transfer of Funds:** After an employee requests an advance, Abhi processes the request and transfers the funds to the employee's account, typically within a short period.\n\n5. **Repayment:** On the upcoming payday, the advanced amount is automatically deducted from the employee's paycheck and repaid to Abhi. The process is facilitated by the employer-payroll integration, ensuring a smooth transaction.\n\n6. **Fees:** Abhi may charge a small fee for providing this service. The fee structure can depend on various factors such as the amount of the advance, employer arrangements, or any promotional offers.\n\nIt's important to understand that when you access your earned wages before the official payday, you're not taking a loan but merely advancing the money that you would receive anyway. EWA services like Abhi aim to provide employees with more flexibility and help them manage their cash flow without resorting to more expensive and risky credit options."

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "The amount of advance you can avail from Abhi or any Earned Wage Access (EWA) service like it typically depends on several factors:\n\n1. **Employer's Policy:** Your employer might have a specific policy regarding the percentage of the earned salary that can be accessed in advance.\n\n2. **Earnings Accumulated:** The amount available for advance will also depend on how much of your salary you have already earned. For instance, if you're halfway through the pay period, you might have earned approximately half of your salary.\n\n3. **Company's Agreement with Abhi:** The exact terms of how Abhi works with your employer can affect the amount you can advance. Some companies may allow a certain percentage of the earned wages to be taken out, while others might have different limitations.\n\nGenerally, EWA services allow employees to access up to a certain percentage of their earned income. This percentage can vary, but it often ranges from 50% to a substantial portion of the net earned salary at that point in the pay cycle. The actual amount available for you to advance will also account for any previous advances you may have taken and the fees associated with the transaction.\n\nFor the most accurate information, you should directly refer to the Abhi app after registering and linking your employment details. The app will calculate how much you can advance based on your specific situation and the agreement with your employer. If you have further questions, contacting Abhi's customer service or your HR department would provide the most relevant guidance."
